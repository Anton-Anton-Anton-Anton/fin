<h2>Framework Information</h2>

<h3>Svelte</h3>
<p>Svelte is a front end framework which serves the same purpose as all other front end frameworks -- interaction with the user at the browser. And it does it in a similar way, insofar as it involves building, using, and reusing components, and managing the state of the application.</p>

<p>Svelte aims to be 'lighter' in many aspects, hence the name, which can light, elegant or slender. This is in particular evident in 2 aspects.</p>

<p> The first is that the component architecture is easier to manage than in React or Angular. The second is that Svelte itself is not required to be running in the browser. 
    Svelte front ends not need a runtime to provide support for their execution. Svelte is in essence a compiler: it takes the .svelte files we write, and it outputs a single javascript file, which then runs natively in the browser. A virtual DOM is not maintained, everything is done to the actual DOM using Svelte.</p>

<p>Svelte can be used to make a single page app like this one, or it can be used to develop a more traditional multipage website. In general it sticks close to the classics: HTML, CSS, and JS, and has a shallow learning curve. Indeed I had to do this project in 2 days, when my React app had something happen to its caching which I couldn't resolve.
</p>
<p>One of Svelte's possible disadvantages is that it is a young framework, which means it has a smaller community and less overall maturity. It is rapidly growing in popularity, and those who use it love it</p>
<p>Svelte is said to be opinionated, which means it has its ideas about how the archtecture should be define. Of course these are the designers' ideas, and we should see for ourselves whether these premade decisions can benefit us.</p>

<h3>NodeJS</h3>

<p>NodeJS is a runtime which is interacted with through JavaScript. It is itself written in C/C++. It works on top of the Chrome's V8 engine for JavaScript</p>
<p>It is broadly useful as a web-development tool. It can be used to install other tools. In general NodeJS is integral to downloading, installing, and keeping-track of the dependencies for running and/or building the projects.</p>


<p>It is not of course limited to that. It can do an impressive variety of things: read/write files and directories, work with the databases, and itself it can be a server. </p>

<p>It is memory efficient, due to being non-blocking, and asynchronous. The requests are sent to the operating system, and NodeJS is ready to handle another one, while the result is being computed. Optionally, this can be bypassed and synchronous calls can be made. </p>

<p>It is a very popular technology and only continues to be a dominant market technology</p>
